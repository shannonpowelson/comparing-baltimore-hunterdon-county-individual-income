First, I edited each of the raw data excel files.  I removed data on any neighborhoods or towns that are not in Baltimore City or Hunterdon County.  
Then, I combined the Baltimore City data.  I put the Individual Income, Job Density, and Population Density data in columns next to each other so that the data lined up for each neighborhood in Baltimore.
I combined the Hunterdon County data.  I put the Individual Income, Job Density, and Population Density data in columns next to each other so that the data lined up for each town in Hunterdon County.  
For each graph, I made a new sheet in excel.  
For the Individual Income graphs, I selected the individual income column and the name (of the neighborhood or town) column and made a bar graph in order to see the distribution of the incomes.  I made one graph for Baltimore City and one for Hunterdon County.
For the combined graph for Job Density and Individual income, I selected the name, individual income, and job density columns.  I inserted a bar graph.  I selected the job density bars and chose a secondary axis.  Then I changed the chart type for job density to a line graph.  I changed the color combinations so that the bars and the lines could be read simultaneously.  I did this for Baltimore City and for Hunterdon County. 
For the combined graph for Population Density, I used the same steps in step 6 except I selected name, individual income, and population density columns to make the graph.
