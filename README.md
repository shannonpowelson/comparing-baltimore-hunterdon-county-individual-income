# Comparing Individual Income in Baltimore City, MD and Hunterdon County, NJ using The Opportunity Atlas
## Background
For this comparison, Baltimore City, MD and Hunterdon County, NJ are being examined.  I grew up in Hunterdon County and came to Baltimore City for college.  The second I arrived in Baltimore, I noticed differences.  Instead of farms and horses on every street, there were skyscrapers, apartments, restaurants, and lots of people.  These differences are obvious and surface level.  For this analysis, I dig beneath the surface and study the individual income in each of these locations.  I am interested in the individual income metric because income can tell us a lot about the structure of a town or city.  I am interested to see how the income distribution compares for city neighborhoods and rural towns.  I was also curious about how population density and job density impacts individual income.  Baltimore has much higher population and job densities than Hunterdon County, so I was interested to see if that had an impact on individual income.
