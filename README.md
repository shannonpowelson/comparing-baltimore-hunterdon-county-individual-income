# Comparing Individual Income in Baltimore City, MD and Hunterdon County, NJ using The Opportunity Atlas
## Background
For this comparison, Baltimore City, MD and Hunterdon County, NJ are being examined.  I grew up in Hunterdon County and came to Baltimore City for college.  The second I arrived in Baltimore, I noticed differences.  Instead of farms and horses on every street, there were skyscrapers, apartments, restaurants, and lots of people.  These differences are obvious and surface level.  For this analysis, I dig beneath the surface and study the individual income in each of these locations.  I am interested in the individual income metric because income can tell us a lot about the structure of a town or city.  I am interested to see how the income distribution compares for city neighborhoods and rural towns.  I was also curious about how population density and job density impacts individual income.  Baltimore has much higher population and job densities than Hunterdon County, so I was interested to see if that had an impact on individual income.  
## Business Question
_How is income distributed in city neighborhoods versus rural towns?_
## Data Sources


## Data Analysis
To start this analysis, we will look at two bar graphs showing the distribution of individual income in Baltimore City, MD and the distribution of income in Hunterdon County, NJ.

The above graphs show that individual income is distributed differently in Baltimore City and Hunterdon County.  In Baltimore City, there is a large range of incomes.  There are very high incomes and very low incomes.  However, in Hunterdon County, the incomes are very similar and consistent.  There are no extreme values like in the incomes for Baltimore City.  

__Why are incomes distributed differently in Baltimore City and Hunterdon County?__

For the next part of the analysis, I tested my hypothesis on why I thought that this difference in income distrbution occurs.  I thought that job density and population density might have an impact on income distribution.  Areas with more available jobs might have higher incomes and areas with higher populations might have lower incomes because of more competition for jobs.  

First, I investigated the impact of job density on income distribution in the following combination charts.

The above graphs show that there is no clear association between job density and individual income distribution in Baltimore City and Hunterdon County.  This shows that the amount of jobs in a certain area is not impacting the income.  

Since job density is not playing a role in income distribution differences, I investigated the impact of population density on income distribution in the following combination charts.

The above graphs show that there is no clear association between individual income distribution and population density in Baltimore City and Hunterdon County.  This shows that the population in a certain area is not impacting the income.
